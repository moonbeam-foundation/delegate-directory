    "description": "Sik Launch Collator, Treasury Councillor, Discord Mod, German Community Admin, Governance Warrior Thanks for checking the details I'm a DotSama native and was supporting Moonriver and Moonbeam from the get-go, collating on Moonbase Alpha testnet before Moonriver crowdloans were even a thing. I was selected as one of the Launch-Collators on Moonriver and later on Moonbeam and been securing the network ever since But I'm not just innit for the tech - I want to connect the people with the tech . So I became a moderator in the official Moonbeam discord and tried to help people solving their problems wherever I could. As german is my native language, I also became admin of the german Telegram group. I always wanted to help driving this project to success and kept up steady conversations with the core team. In late 2022 I became a Treasury Council Member, which I'm still super honoured to be part of - bringing in my technical knowledge to properly evaluate the proposals. Last but not least I wanted to point out that I'm not only into Moonbeam and Moonriver Governance, but also got a track record being a gov Delegate on Kusama and Polkadot, serving as Councillor for HydraDX and Basilisk, or acting as Identity Registrar on several chains. No matter what you want to talk about - you can always reach out to me",
